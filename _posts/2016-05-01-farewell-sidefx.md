Slightly late, but this last Friday was my last day at Side Effects Software. It's been incredible two years and SideFX is perhaps the most amazing place I have ever worked at. I have truly enjoyed working on Houdini and Houdini Engine and now I look forward to working with Houdini in a different capacity and on the other side of the fence. I am also thankful for this experience of working with such an extraordinary group of people. The depth of knowledge was at times overwhelming and being able to learn from you all has been a blessing. You became a family and I will miss you all.
